Alleluia!\n<br>Our hearts are pining to see thy shining;\ndying or living, to thee are cleaving;\nnaught can us sever. Alleluia!"

      "text": "If God be ours, we fear no powers,\nnot of earth or sin or death.\nGod sees and blesses in worst distresses,\nand can change them in a breath.\n<br>Wherefore the story tell of God's glory\nwith heart and voices; all heaven rejoices,\nsinging forever: Alleluia!\n<br>We shout for gladness, triumph o'er sadness,\nloving and praising, voices still raising\nglad hymns forever: Alleluia!"
