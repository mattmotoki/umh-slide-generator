      "text": "O what glory, far exceeding\nall that eye has yet perceived!\nHoliest hearts, for ages pleading,\nnever that full joy conceived.\n<br>God has promised, Christ prepares it,\nthere on high our welcome waits.\nEvery humble spirit shares it;\nChrist has passed th'eternal gates."

      "text": "Life eternal! heaven rejoices:\nJesus lives, who once was dead.\nJoin we now the deathless voices;\nchild of God, lift up your head!\n<br>Patriarchs from the distant ages,\nsaints all longing for their heaven,\nprophets, psalmists, seers, and sages,\nall await the glory given."
