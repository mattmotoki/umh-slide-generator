      "page_name": "Verse 2",
      "text": "My heart is weak and poor\nuntil it master find;\nit has no spring of action sure,\nit varies with the wind.\n<br>It cannot freely move\ntill thou hast wrought its chain;\nenslave it with thy matchless love,\nand deathless it shall reign."

      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "My power is faint and low\ntill I have learned to serve;\nit lacks the needed fire to glow,\nit lacks the breeze to nerve.\n<br>It cannot drive the world\nuntil itself be driven;\nits flag can only be unfurled\nwhen thou shalt breathe from heaven."

      "page_name": "Verse 4",
      "text": "My will is not my own\ntill thou hast made it thine;\nif it would reach a monarch's throne,\nit must its crown resign.\n<br>It only stands unbent\namid the clashing strife,\nwhen on thy bosom it has leant,\nand found in thee its life."
