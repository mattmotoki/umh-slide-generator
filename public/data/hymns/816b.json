      "text": "Stony the road we trod,\nbitter the chast'ning rod,\nfelt in the days when hope unborn had died;\n<br>Yet with a steady beat,\nhave not our weary feet\ncome to the place\nfor which our people sighed?\n<br>We have come over a way\nthat with tears has been watered,\nwe have come, treading our path\nthrough the blood of the slaughtered;\n<br>Out from the gloomy past,\ntill now we stand at last\nwhere the bright gleam\nof our bright star is cast."
