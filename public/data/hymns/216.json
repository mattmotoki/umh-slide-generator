      "text": "Lo, how a Rose e'er blooming\nFrom tender stem hath sprung!\nOf Jesse's lineage coming\nAs men of old have sung.\n<br>It came, a flower bright,\nAmid the cold of winter\nWhen half-gone was the night."

      "text": "Isaiah 'twas foretold it,\nThe Rose I have in mind:\nWith Mary we behold it,\nThe virgin mother kind.\n<br>To show God's love aright\nShe bore to men a Savior\nWhen half-gone was the night."
