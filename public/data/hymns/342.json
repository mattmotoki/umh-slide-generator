      "page_name": "Verse 1",
      "text": "Where shall my wondering soul begin?\nHow shall I all to heaven aspire?\nA slave redeemed from death and sin,\n<br>a brand plucked from eternal fire,\nhow shall I equal triumphs raise,\nor sing my great deliverer's praise?"
    },
    {
      "page_name": "Verse 2",
      "text": "O how shall I the goodness tell,\nFather, which thou to me hast showed?\nThat I, a child of wrath and hell,\n<br>I should be called a child of God!\nShould know, should feel my sins forgiven,\nblest with this antepast of heaven!"
    },
    {
      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "And shall I slight my Father's love,\nor basely fear his gifts to own?\nUnmindful of his favors prove,\n<br>shall I, the hallowed cross to shun,\nrefuse his righteousness to impart,\nby hiding it within my heart?"
    },
    {
      "page_name": "Verse 4",
      "text": "Outcasts of men, to you I call,\nharlots, and publicans, and thieves;\nhe spreads his arms to embrace you all,\n<br>sinners alone his grace receive.\nNo need of Him the righteous have;\nhe came the lost to seek and save."
    },
    {
      "page_name": "Verse 5",
      "text": "Come, O my guilty brethren, come,\ngroaning beneath your load of sin;\nhis bleeding heart shall make you room,\n<br>his open side shall take you in.\nHe calls you now, invites you home:\nCome, O my guilty brethren, come."
    },
    {
      "page_name": "Verse 6",
      "text": "For you the purple current flowed\nin pardon from his wounded side,\nlanguished for you the eternal God,\n<br>for you the Prince of Glory died.\nBelieve, and all your sin's forgiven,\nonly believe--and yours is heaven."
