How can it be\nthat thou, my God, shouldst die for me?\nAmazing love! How can it be\nthat thou, my God, shouldst die for me?"

Let earth adore;\nlet angel minds inquire no more.\n'Tis mercy all! Let earth adore;\nlet angel minds inquire no more."

      "text": "Long my imprisoned spirit lay,\nfast bound in sin and nature's night;\nthine eye diffused a quickening ray;\nI woke, the dungeon flamed with light;\n<br>my chains fell off, my heart was free,\nI rose, went forth, and followed thee.\nMy chains fell off, my heart was free,\nI rose, went forth, and followed thee."
