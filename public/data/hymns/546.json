      "text": "The Church's one foundation\nIs Jesus Christ her Lord;\nShe is his new creation,\nBy water and the word;\n<br>From Heav'n he came and sought her\nTo be his holy bride;\nWith his own blood he bought her,\nAnd for her life he died."

      "page_name": "Verse 2",
      "text": "Elect from ev'ry nation,\nYet one o'er all the Earth,\nHer charter of salvation\nOne Lord, one faith, one birth;\n<br>One holy name she blesses,\nPartakes one holy food,\nAnd to one hope she presses,\nWith ev'ry grace endued."

      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "'Mid toil and tribulation\nAnd tumult of her war,\nShe waits the consummation\nOf peace forever more;\n<br>Till with the vision glorious\nHer longing eyes are blest,\nAnd the great Church victorious\nShall be the Church at rest."
    },
    {
      "page_name": "Verse 4",
      "text": "O happy ones and holy!\nLord, give us grace that we\nLike them, the meek and lowly,\nOn high may dwell with thee;\n<br>There, past the border mountains,\nWhere in sweet vales, the bride\nWith thee, by living fountains,\nForever shall abide!"
