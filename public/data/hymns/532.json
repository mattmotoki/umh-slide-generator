      "text": "In thine arms I rest me;\nfoes who would molest me\ncannot reach me here.\nThough the earth be shaking,\n<br>every heart be quaking,\nJesus calms our fear;\nsin and hell in conflict fell\n<br>with their heaviest storms assail us;\nJesus will not fail us."

      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "Hence, all thoughts of sadness!\nFor the Lord of gladness,\nJesus, enters in.\nThose who love the Father,\n<br>though the storms may gather,\nstill have peace within;\nyea, whate'er we here must bear,\n<br>still in thee lies purest pleasure,\nJesus, priceless treasure!"
