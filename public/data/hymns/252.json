      "text": "When Jesus came to Jordan\nTo be baptized by John,\nHe did not come for pardon,\nBut as his Father's Son.\n<br>He came to share repentance\nWith all who mourn their sins,\nTo speak the vital sentence\nWith which good news begins."

      "text": "He came to share temptation,\nOur utmost woe and loss,\nFor us and our salvation\nTo die upon the cross.\n<br>So when the Dove descended\nOn him, the Son of Man,\nThe hidden years had ended,\nThe age of grace began."

      "text": "Come, Holy Spirit, aid us\nTo keep the vows we make,\nThis very day invade us,\nAnd every bondage break.\n<br>Come, give our lives direction,\nThe gift we covet most:\nTo share the resurrection\nThat leads to Pentecost."
