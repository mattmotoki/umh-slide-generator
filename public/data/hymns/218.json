      "text": "Still through the cloven skies they come\nwith peaceful wings unfurled,\nand still their heavenly music floats\no'er all the weary world;\n<br>above its sad and lowly plains,\nthey bend on hovering wing,\nand ever o'er its Babel sounds\nthe blessed angels sing."

      "text": "And ye, beneath life's crushing load,\nwhose forms are bending low,\nwho toil along the climbing way\nwith painful steps and slow,\n<br>look now! for glad and golden hours\ncome swiftly on the wing.\nO rest beside the weary road,\nand hear the angels sing!"

      "text": "For lo! the days are hastening on,\nby prophet seen of old,\nwhen with the ever-circling years\nshall come the time foretold\n<br>when peace shall over all the earth\nits ancient splendors fling,\nand the whole world send back the song\nwhich now the angels sing."
