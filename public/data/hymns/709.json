      "text": "One family we dwell in him,\none church above, beneath,\nthough now divided by the stream,\nthe narrow stream of death;\n<br>one army of the living God,\nto his command we bow;\npart of his host have crossed the flood,\nand part are crossing now."

      "text": "Ten thousand to their endless home\nthis solemn moment fly,\nand we are to the margin come,\nand we expect to die.\n<br>E'en now by faith we join our hands\nwith those that went before,\nand greet the blood-besprinkled bands\non the eternal shore."

      "text": "Our spirits too shall quickly join,\nlike theirs with glory crowned,\nand shout to see our Captain's sign,\nto hear his trumpet sound.\n<br>O that we now might grasp our Guide!\nO that the word were given!\nCome, Lord of Hosts, the waves divide,\nand land us all in heaven."
