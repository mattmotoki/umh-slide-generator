      "text": "Lift every voice and sing, till earth and heaven ring,\nring with the harmonies of liberty;\nlet our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies,\nlet it resound loud as the rolling sea.\n<br>Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us;\nsing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;\n<br>facing the rising sun of our new day begun,\nlet us march on till victory is won."

      "text": "Stony the road we trod, bitter the chastening rod,\nfelt in the days when hope unborn had died;\nyet with a steady beat, have not our weary feet\ncome to the place for which our fathers sighed?\n<br>We have come over a way that with tears has been watered;\nwe have come, treading our path thru the blood of the slaughtered,\n<br>out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last\nwhere the white gleam of our bright star is cast."

      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,\nthou who hast brought us thus far on the way;\nthou who hast by thy might led us into the light,\nkeep us forever in the path, we pray.\n<br>Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee;\nlest our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee;\n<br>shadowed beneath thy hand, may we forever stand,\ntrue to our God, true to our native land."
