      "text": "Have we trials and temptations?\nIs there trouble anywhere?\nWe should never be discouraged;\ntake it to the Lord in prayer.\n<br>Can we find a friend so faithful\nwho will all our sorrows share?\nJesus knows our every weakness;\ntake it to the Lord in prayer."

      "text": "Are we weak and heavy laden,\ncumbered with a load of care?\nPrecious Savior, still our refuge;\ntake it to the Lord in prayer.\n<br>Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?\nTake it to the Lord in prayer!\nIn his arms he'll take and shield thee;\nthou wilt find a solace there."
