      "text": "When he first the work begun,\nsmall and feeble was his day;\nnow the Word doth swiftly run,\nnow it wins its widening way;\n<br>more and more it spreads and grows,\never mighty to prevail;\nsin's strongholds it now o'erthrows,\nshakes the trembling gates of hell."

      "text": "Saints of God, your Savior praise,\nwho the door hath opened wide;\nhe hath given the word of grace,\nJesus' word is glorified;\n<br>Jesus mighty to redeem,\nwho alone the work hath wrought;\nworthy is the work of him,\nhim who spake a world from naught."

      "text": "Saw ye not the cloud arise,\nlittle as a human hand?\nNow it spreads along the skies,\nhangs o'er all the thirsty land.\n<br>Lo! the promise of a shower\ndrops already from above;\nbut the Lord will shortly pour\nall the spirit of his love."
