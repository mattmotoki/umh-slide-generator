      "text": "See, the streams of living waters,\nspringing from eternal love,\nwell supply thy sons and daughters,\nand all fear of want remove.\n<br>Who can faint while such a river\never will their thirst assuage?\nGrace which like the Lord, the giver,\nnever fails from age to age."

      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "Round each habitation hovering,\nsee the cloud and fire appear\nfor a glory and a covering,\nshowing that the Lord is near!\n<br>Thus deriving from our banner\nlight by night and shade by day,\nsafe we feed upon the manna\nwhich God gives us when we pray."

      "page_name": "Verse 4",
      "text": "Blest inhabitants of Zion,\nwashed in our Redeemer's blood;\nJesus, whom our souls rely on,\nmakes us monarchs, priests to God.\n<br>Us, by his great love, he raises,\nrulers over self to reign,\nand as priests his solemn praises\nwe for thankful offering bring."
