      "text": "We come with self-inflicted pains\nof broken trust and chosen wrong,\nhalf-free, half-bound by inner chains,\nby social forces swept along,\n<br>by powers and systems close confined,\nyet seeking hope for humankind."

      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "Great God, in Christ you call our name\nand then receive us as your own,\nnot through some merit, right or claim,\nbut by your gracious love alone.\n<br>We strain to glimpse your mercy seat\nand find you kneeling at our feet."

      "text": "Then take the towel, and break the bread,\nand humble us, and call us friends.\nSuffer and serve till all are fed,\nand show how grandly love intends\n<br>to work till all creation sings,\nto fill all worlds, to crown all things."
    },
    {
      "page_name": "Verse 5",
      "text": "Great God, in Christ you set us free\nyour life to live, your joy to share.\nGive us your Spirit's liberty\nto turn from guilt and dull despair\n<br>and offer all that faith can do\nwhile love is making all things new."
