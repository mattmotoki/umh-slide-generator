      "text": "O day of peace that dimly shines\nthrough all our hopes and prayers and dreams,\nguide us to justice, truth, and love,\ndelivered from our selfish schemes.\n<br>May swords of hate fall from our hands,\nour hearts from envy find release,\ntill by God's grace our warring world\nshall see Christ's promised reign of peace."

      "text": "Then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb,\nnor shall the fierce devour the small.\nAs beasts and cattle calmly graze,\na little child shall lead them all.\n<br>Then enemies shall learn to love,\nall creatures find their true accord.\nThe hope of peace shall be fulfilled,\nfor all the earth shall know the Lord."
