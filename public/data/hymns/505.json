      "page_name": "Verse 1",
      "text": "When our confidence is shaken\nIn beliefs we thought secure;\nWhen the spirit in its sickness\nSeeks but cannot find a cure:\n<br>God is active in the tensions\nOf a faith not yet mature."
    },
    {
      "page_name": "Verse 2",
      "text": "Solar systems, void of meaning,\nFreeze the spirit into stone;\nAlways our researches lead us\nTo the ultimate Unknown:\n<br>Faith must die, or come full circle\nTo its source in God alone."
    },
    {
      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "In the discipline of praying,\nWhen it's hardest to believe;\nIn the drudgery of caring,\nWhen it's not enough to grieve:\n<br>Faith maturing, learns acceptance\nOf the insights we receive."
    },
    {
      "page_name": "Verse 4",
      "text": "God is love; and He redeems us\nIn the Christ we crucify:\nThis is God's eternal answer\nTo the world's eternal why;\n<br>May we in this faith maturing\nBe content to live and die."
