      "text": "O young and fearless Prophet of ancient Galilee,\nthy life is still a summons to serve humanity;\n<br>to make our thoughts and actions less prone to please the crowd,\nto stand with humble courage for truth with hearts uncowed."

      "page_name": "Verse 2",
      "text": "We marvel at the purpose that held thee to thy course\nwhile ever on the hilltop before thee loomed the cross;\n<br>thy steadfast face set forward where love and duty shone,\nwhile we betray so quickly and leave thee there alone."

      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "O help us stand unswerving against war's bloody way,\nwhere hate and lust and falsehood hold back Christ's holy sway;\n<br>forbid false love of country that blinds us to his call,\nwho lifts above the nations the unity of all."

    {
      "page_name": "Verse 4",
      "text": "Stir up in us a protest against our greed for wealth,\nwhile others starve and hunger and plead for work and health;\n<br>where homes with little children cry out for lack of bread,\nwho live their years sore burdened beneath a gloomy dread."

      "page_name": "Verse 5",
      "text": "O young and fearless Prophet, we need thy presence here,\namid our pride and glory to see thy face appear;\n<br>once more to hear thy challenge above our noisy day,\nagain to lead us forward along God's holy way."
