      "text": "Sing of Jesus, son of Mary,\nIn the home at Nazareth.\nToil and labor cannot weary\nLove enduring unto death.\n<br>Constant was the love he gave her,\nThough he went forth from her side,\nForth to preach, and heal, and suffer,\nTill on Calvary he died."

      "text": "Glory be to God the Father;\nGlory be to God the Son;\nGlory be to God the Spirit;\nGlory to the Three in One.\n<br>From the heart of blessed Mary,\nFrom all saints the song ascends,\nAnd the Church the strain reechoes\nUnto earth's remotest ends."
