      "text": "Holy God, we praise thy name!\nLord of all, we bow before thee!\nAll on Earth thy sceptre claim,\n<br>All in Heav'n above adore thee;\nInfinite thy vast domain,\nEverlasting is thy reign."

      "page_name": "Verse 2",
      "text": "Hark! the loud celestial hymn\nAngel choirs above are raising!\nCherubim and seraphim,\n<br>In unceasing chorus praising,\nFill the heav'ns with sweet accord;\nHoly, holy, holy, Lord!"

      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "Lo! the apostolic train\nJoin thy sacred name to hallow!\nProphets swell the loud refrain,\n<br>And the white-robed martyrs follow,\nAnd from morn to set of sun,\nThrough the Church the song goes on."

      "page_name": "Verse 4",
      "text": "Holy Father, holy Son,\nHoly Spirit, Three we name thee,\nThough in essence only one,\n<br>Undivided God we claim thee;\nAnd adoring bend the knee,\nWhile we own the mystery."

      "page_name": "Verse 5",
      "text": "Thou art King of glory, Christ!\nSon of God, yet born of Mary;\nFor us sinners sacrificed,\n<br>And to death a tributary;\nFirst to break the bars of death,\nThou hast opened Heav'n to faith."

      "page_name": "Verse 6",
      "text": "From thy high celestial home,\nJudge of all, again returning,\nWe believe that thou shalt come\n<br>On the dreadful doomsday morning,\nWhen thy voice shall shake the earth,\nAnd the startled dead come forth."

      "page_name": "Verse 7",
      "text": "Spare thy people, Lord, we pray,\nBy a thousand snares surrounded;\nKeep us without sin today;\n<br>Never let us be confounded!\nLo! I put my trust in thee;\nNever, Lord, abandon me."
