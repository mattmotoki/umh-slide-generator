      "text": "We have ventured worlds undreamed of\nsince the childhood of our race,\nknown the ecstasy of winging\nthrough untraveled realms of space,\n<br>probed the secrets of the atom,\nyielding unimagined pow'r,\nfacing us with life's destruction\nor our most triumphant hour."

      "text": "As each far horizon beckons,\nmay it challenge us anew,\nchildren of creative purpose\nserving others, hon'ring you.\n<br>May our dreams prove rich with promise,\neach endeavor well begun.\nGreat creator, give us guidance\ntill our goals and yours are one."
