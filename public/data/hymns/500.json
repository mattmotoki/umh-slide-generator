      "text": "Hast thou not bid me love thee, God and King?\nAll, all thine own, soul, heart and strength and mind.\n<br>I see thy cross; there teach my heart to cling.\nO let me seek thee, and O let me find!"

      "page_name": "Verse 4",
      "text": "Teach me to feel that thou art always nigh;\nteach me the struggles of the soul to bear.\n<br>To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh,\nteach me the patience of unanswered prayer."

      "page_name": "Verse 5",
      "text": "Teach me to love thee as thine angels love,\none holy passion filling all my frame;\n<br>the kindling of the heaven-descended Dove,\nmy heart an altar, and thy love the flame."
