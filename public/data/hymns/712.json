      "page_name": "Verse 2",
      "text": "They loved their Lord so dear, so dear,\nand his love made them strong;\nand they followed the right for Jesus' sake\nthe whole of their good lives long.\n<br>And one was a soldier, and one was a priest,\nand one was slain by a fierce wild beast;\nand there's not any reason, no, not the least,\nwhy I shouldn't be one too."

      "page_name": "Verse 3",
      "text": "They lived not only in ages past;\nthere are hundreds of thousands still.\nThe world is bright with the joyous saints\nwho love to do Jesus' will.\n<br>You can meet them in school, on the street, in the store,\nin church, by the sea, in the house next door;\nthey are saints of God, whether rich or poor,\nand I mean to be one too."
