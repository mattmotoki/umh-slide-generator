      "text": "Christ is risen! Raise your spirits\nfrom the caverns of despair.\nWalk with gladness in the morning.\nSee what love can do and dare.\n<br>Drink the wine of resurrection,\nnot a servant, but a friend;\nJesus is our strong companion—\njoy and peace shall never end."

      "text": "Christ is risen! Earth and heaven\nnevermore shall be the same.\nBreak the bread of new creation\nwhere the world is still in pain.\n<br>Tell its grim, demonic chorus,\n\"Christ is risen! Get you gone!\"\nGod the First and Last is with us.\nSing hosanna, ev'ry one!"
